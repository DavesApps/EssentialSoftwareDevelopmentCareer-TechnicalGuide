Agile reminds me of an old movie called Invasion of the Body Snatchers, where people were replaced with aliens that looked just like them.

It‚Äôs almost like software engineers have been replaced with people thinking the exact opposite of the way they thought before.

Don‚Äôt believe me? Before, Agile programmers hated meetings, and they probably only had one meeting a week or two, maybe less.

With Agile, programmers have now accepted not 1 meeting, not 2 meetings, but 13 meetings in two weeks! Like I said, it‚Äôs like the opposite alien took over. You have your sprint planning, grooming, reveal, and oh, let‚Äôs not forget the 10 scrum meetings.

Before Agile, developers hated being asked about their status. Of course, now, we have those 10 daily scrum meetings per sprint to solve that. I know, I know, they are not status meetings (wink). It‚Äôs like the opposite people are inhabiting your bodies.

What do programmers do all day? You know. Sit and code. And what do they ask you to do in Scrum? Stand up! Still don‚Äôt think opposite aliens have inhabited programmers yet? Still not enough evidence for you?

Before Agile, programmers hated deadlines. There would be a deadline once a release. Now, you have accepted deadlines every two weeks for sprints!

Before Agile, QA and development were more separated. Now, they work together. Even more opposites.

So if this is all made up, and it‚Äôs not alien body snatchers, why did people related to the Agile process have to say it‚Äôs friendly with the term the three amigos?

More opposites. A lot of developers, let‚Äôs be honest, mostly just code and don‚Äôt have time for sports. So what they do is steal the rugby term ‚Äúscrum.‚Äù There are more terms you have heard of, like ‚Äúswarm,‚Äù which may be taken from lacrosse.

So we are comparing this idea of people who are not who they once were, like aliens. If aliens were to have thought up this concept, what terms might they use? Hmm . . . Velocity and Burn-Down might come to mind. Coincidence?

Here, we are talking about having people basically cloned and, of course, what term do you hear with Agile? Pair programming. Coincidence?

It‚Äôs almost like up doesn‚Äôt mean up, down doesn‚Äôt mean down . . . Oh wait, done doesn‚Äôt mean done. Now, you have to say, ‚ÄúDone done done.‚Äù

So you know if there were aliens, they would probably even play some alien games. You know, different from the rest of the human race. Oh, wait, you play Planning Poker. Hmm . . .

Still don‚Äôt believe it? These body snatchers have made you liars. What do little kids get told at bedtime? Of course, stories. I know what you are thinking. Stories have more than one meaning. They could be fiction or non-fiction. But of course, they go and estimate them in another word for lies: Fibs! So I know what they meant by stories.

Still don‚Äôt believe me? Lots of villains, some aliens, liked to be called this. For example, in Star Wars, what did Darth Vader call the emperor? That‚Äôs right, Master. And of course, we have Scrum Master in Agile. What does that make you?

So I know now that probably every one of you has been taken over.

You know, maybe it‚Äôs not body snatchers or clones. Maybe they can take over your mind with just a thought that could explain all of this.

This reminds me. Before Agile, most projects were late, and now, not so much. So maybe this whole body snatcher, clone, mind-control thing isn‚Äôt so bad.

Oh crap, I‚Äôm late for Scrum. Bye, amigos! And now, I‚Äôm ‚Äúdone done done.‚Äù

(Don‚Äôt be late for Zombie scrum üôÇ )
